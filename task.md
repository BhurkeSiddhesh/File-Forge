# Task: Merge Jules' Branches into pdf_updates

## Plan
1. [ ] Analyze changes in each branch to understand what's missing or needs @jules attention.
    - [ ] origin/feature-add-tests-and-readme-...
    - [ ] origin/feature-ai-pdf-to-word-paddle-...
    - [ ] origin/perf/defer-pikepdf-import-...
    - [ ] origin/perf/directory-batch-processing-...
2. [ ] Merge each branch into `pdf_updates`.
    - [ ] Merge origin/feature-add-tests-and-readme-...
    - [ ] Merge origin/feature-ai-pdf-to-word-paddle-...
    - [ ] Merge origin/perf/defer-pikepdf-import-...
    - [ ] Merge origin/perf/directory-batch-processing-...
3. [ ] Identify missing parts and add comments with @jules.
4. [ ] Run tests to ensure no regressions.
5. [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` and commit.

## Verification Strategy
- git diff to see merged changes.
- `npm run test` or equivalent if available.
- Manual inspection of the merged code.
